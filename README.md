### Hi, I'm Anton ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer who specializes in backend. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. 

I want to create software that will help people solve their problems or make their life easier. Therefore, I'm attracted to the development of new software products, but I'm also not afraid of legacy projects, since they are already used by people and bring them benefits. I'm interested in working both in product companies and in outsourcing. My goal is to become a highly qualified specialist in order to benefit customers and people.
